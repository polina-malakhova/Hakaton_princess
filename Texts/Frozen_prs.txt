sleeps in her bed. her little sister anna: (5) pops up beside her.
elsa. psst. elsa! psst. elsa doesn't stir. anna sits on elsa and bounces. 
wake up. wake up. wake up. 
anna, go back to sleep. 
i just can't. the sky's awake, so i'm awake, so we have to play. 
...go play by yourself. 
do you want to build a snowman? 
come on, come on, come on, come on. 
the girls sneak into the ballroom. elsa shuts the door. 
do the magic! do the magic! 
this is amazing! 
watch this! 
hi, i'm olaf and i like warm hugs. 
i love you, olaf. 
catch me! 
gotcha! 
again! again! 
slow down! 
mama! papa! 
the parents burst through the frozen door. gasp at the sight of the room. 
it was an accident. i'm sorry, anna. 
but she won't remember i have powers? 
do you want to build a snowman? come on let's go and play. 
i never see you anymore. come out the door. it's like you've gone away. 
we used to be best buddies and now we're not. i wish you would tell me why. 
's door. anna peeks through the key hole. 
do you want to build a snowman? anna calls through the keyhole. 
it doesn't have to be a snowman. 
go away, anna. 
...okay bye. 
don't feel it. 
& king don't let it show. 
do you want to build a snowman? or ride our bike around the hall? i think some company is overdue... 
i've started talking to the pictures on the walls. 
hang in there, joan. 
it gets a little lonely all these empty rooms. 
just watching the hours tick by. 
tick tock. tick tock. tick tock. 
i'm scared. it's getting stronger. 
no. don't touch me. i don't want to hurt you. 
see you in two weeks. 
do you have to go? 
elsa? please i know you're in there people are asking where you've been they say have courage and i'm trying to i'm right out here for you. please let me in. 
we only have each other. it's just you and me. what are we gonna do? 
do you want to build a snowman? 
...huh? yeah? 
no, you didn't. i've been up for hours. 
who is it? 
ready for what? 
my sister's corneration... 
coronation day! ha ha! 
the window is open! so's that door! i didn't know they did that anymore. who knew we owned 8000 salad plates...? anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks. 
for years i have roamed these empty halls why have a ballroom with no balls? finally, they're opening up the gates! she shakes hands with a suit of armor. breaks it. hides the evidence. 
there'll be real, actual people it'll be totally strange. but wow am i so ready for this change! anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washer's pulley. she raises herself up to see the ships arriving. 
for the first time in forever, there'll be music, there'll be light. for the first time in forever, i'll be dancing through the night. anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese. 
don't know if i'm elated or gassy, but i'm somewhere in that zone 'cause for the first time in forever, i won't be alone. 
i can't wait to meet everyone.... 
tonight, imagine me gown and allfetchingly draped against the wall. the picture of sophisticated grace. she notices the bust of a man across the room. 
i suddenly see him standing there, a beautiful stranger tall and fair. 
i wanna stuff some chocolate in my 
but then we laugh and talk all evening, which is totally bizarre. nothing like the life i've led so far. 
for the first time in forever, there'll be magic, there'll be fun. for the first time in forever, i could be noticed by someone. and i know it is totally crazy to dream i'd find romance. but for the first time in forever, at least i've got a chance! 
don't let them in. don't let them see. be the good girl you always have to be. 
conceal. don't feel. put on a show. make one wrong move and everyone will know. 
but it's only for today. 
it's only for today! 
it's agony to wait. 
it's agony to wait!!! 
tell the guards to open up the gate. 
for the first time in 
don't let them in don't let them see 
i'm getting what i'm dreaming of 
be the good girl you always have to be 
a chance to leave my sister's world a chance to find true love 
conceal. conceal. don't feel. don't let them know. 
i know it all ends tomorrow, so it has to be today!! ‘cause for the first time in forever. . . for the first time in forever! nothing's in my way!!! 
hey! 
hey. iya, no. no. i'm okay. 
yeah, i just wasn't looking where i was going. but i'm okay. 
i'm great, actually. 
princess anna of arendelle. 
hi...again. 
ha. this is awkward. not you're awkward, but just because we're i'm awkward. you're gorgeous. 
wait, what? 
no. nono. it's fine. i'm not that princess. i mean, if you'd hit my sister elsa, that would beyeash! ‘cuz, you know... 
hello. 
but, lucky you, it'sit's just me. 
...the bells. the coronation. iii better go. i have to...i better go. 
bye! 
here? are you sure? 
...hi. 
hi me...? oh. um. hi. 
...you look beautiful. 
thank you. you look beautifuller. i mean, not fuller. you don't look fuller, but more beautiful. 
thank you. so, this is what a party looks like? 
it's warmer than i thought. 
and what is that amazing smell? 
and elsa
thank you...only i don't dance. 
but my sister does. 
what? 
oh, i don't think 
sorry. 
ow. ow. 
...no. 
well, he was sprightly. 
especially for a man in heels. 
are you okay? 
i've never been better. this is so nice. i wish it could be like this all the time. 
why not? if 
it just can't. 
excuse me for a minute. 
hans. 
i often had the whole parlor to myself to slide... oops. sorry. 
...your physique helps i'm sure. 
i was born with it, although i dreamt i was kissed by a troll. 
yeah, the whole thing! you got it. they laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face. 
okay wait, wait. so you have how many brothers? 
that's horrible. 
...and sisters. elsa and i were really close when we were little. but then, one day she just shut me out, and i never knew why. he takes her hand. leans in close. 
okay, can i just say something crazy? 
all my life has been a series of doors in my face. and then suddenly i bump into you. 
but with youhans but with you, i found my place. 
i see your face. 
what? 
i've never met someone both who thinks so much like me. 
say goodbye hans say goodbye frozen 
can i just say something even crazier? yes. 
oops! pardon. sorry. can we just get around you there? thank you. oh, there she is. elsa! 
i mean...queen.... me again. um. may i present prince hans of the southern isles. 
we would like 
of 
/hans our marriage! 
marriage...? 
yes! 
i'm sorry, i'm confused. 
well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves. we'll need a few days to plan the ceremony. of course we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream and then wait. would we live here? 
here? 
anna 
oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us 
what? no, no, no, no, no. 
of course we have the room. i don't know. some of them must 
wait. slow down. no one's brothers are staying here. no one is getting married. 
wait, what? 
may i talk to you, please. alone. 
no. whatever you have to say, you you can say to both of us. 
fine. you can't marry a man you just met. 
you can if it's true love. 
anna, what do you know about true love? 
more than you. all you know is how to shut people out. 
you asked for my blessing, but my answer is no. now, excuse me. 
no, you may not. and i ... i think you should go. 
the party is over. close the gates. 
what? elsa, no. no, wait! 
give me my glove! 
elsa, please. please. i can't live like this anymore. 
...then leave. 
...what did i ever do to you?! 
enough, anna. 
no. why? why do you shut me out?! why do you shut the world out?! what are you so afraid of?! 
i said, enough! 
elsa...? 
please, just stay away from me. stay away! 
elsa! wait, please! 
no. 
no. 
wait, no! 
no. no. i'm completely ordinary. 
...and my sister's not a monster. 
it was an accident. she was scared. she didn't mean it. she didn't mean any of this.... tonight was my fault. i pushed her. so i'm the one that needs to go after her. 
bring me my horse, please. 
elsa's not dangerous. i'll bring her back, and i'll make this right. 
no, i need you here to take care of arendelle. 
i leave prince hans in charge! 
she's my sister; she would never hurt me. 
the snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen. a kingdom of isolation and it looks like i'm the queen. the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside. couldn't keep it in, heaven knows i tried. . . don't let them in, don't let them see, be the good girl you always have to be. conceal, don't feel, don't let them know. well, now they know. 
let it go. let it go. can't hold it back anymore. 
let it go. let it go. turn away and slam the door. i don't care what they're going to say. let the storm rage on. the cold never bothered me anyway. 
it's funny how some distance makes everything seem small. and the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all. it's time to see what i can do, to test the limits and break through. no right, no wrong, no rules for me...i'm free! elsa creates ice steps and climbs them. 
let it go! let it go! i am one with the wind and sky. let it go! let it go! you'll never see me cry. here i stand and here i'll stay. elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake. 
let the storm rage on.... 
my power flurries through the air into the ground. my soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around. and one thought crystallizes like an icy blast 
i'm never going back, 
the past is in the past! 
let it go! let it go! and i'll rise like the break of dawn. let it go! let it go! 
that perfect girl is gone. here i stand in the light of day. let the storm rage on!! the cold never bothered me anyway. 
elsa! elsa! it's me, anna...your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer. i'm sorry. it's all my fffffffault. 
of course, none of this would have happened if she'd just told me her secret...ha...she's a stinker. a branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. anna goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. she sits up. spits out snow. sees the horse running away. 
oh no. no. no. no. come back. no. no. no. no.... ooookay. 
snow, it had to be snow, she couldn't have had trtrtropical magic that covered the fffjords in white sand and warm she sees smoke rising up in the distance. 
cold, cold, cold, cold, cold... 
wandering oaken's trading post. 
ooh! and sauna... 
oh, great. for now, how about boots. winter boots...and dresses? 
oh. um, i was just wondering; has another woman, the queen perhaps, i don't know, passed through here? 
huh? 
oh, right. excuse me. 
north mountain. 
ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now. i mean, that is really... 
ahem. that's unfortunate. 
okay, just tell me one thing; what was happening on the north mountain? did it seem magical? 
nice duet. 
i want you to take me up the north mountain. 
let me rephrase that... 
take me up the north mountain.... please. 
look, i know how to stop this winter. 
oops. sorry. sorry. i'm sorry. i didn't 
we leave now. right now. 
i like fast! 
ew. no, i was raised in a castle. 
...oh well, it was all my fault. i got engaged but then she freaked out because i'd only just met him, you know, that day. and she said she wouldn't bless the marriage 
yeah. anyway, i got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and i grabbed her glove 
yes. pay attention. but the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so i just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt. 
yes, they did.... but hans is not a stranger. 
...ofthesouthernisles? 
...sandwiches. 
probably john. 
dreamy. 
foot size doesn't matter. 
picks his nose? 
excuse me, sir. he's a prince. 
ew. look it doesn't matter; it's true love. 
are you some sort of love expert? 
you have friends who are love experts.... i'm not buying it. 
no, no, no. i'd like to meet these 
what are they? 
wolves. what do we do? 
but i wanna help. 
why not? 
excuse me?! 
it's true love! 
christopher! 
duck! 
but i didn't. 
get ready to jump, sven! 
pull, sven! pull! 
whoa.... i'll replace your sled and everything in it. kristoff groans. 
and i understand if you don't want to help me anymore. 
you are?! 
i mean, sure. i'll let you tag along. 
ext. mountain forest clearing — day
arendelle. 
...but it'll be fine. elsa will thaw it. 
...yeah. now come on. this way to the north mountain? 
i never knew winter could be so beautiful. 
i don't want it! 
don't! 
no! 
ew, ew, the body! 
...okay. wait one second. 
you're welcome. 
well, almost. 
oh! too hard. i'm sorry! ii, i was just.... are you okay? 
olaf?...that's right, olaf. 
oh, um...i'm anna. 
that's sven. 
...sven. 
olaf, did elsa build you? 
do you know where she is? 
do you think you could show us the way? 
don't you dare. 
i'm coming! 
oh, i am gonna talk to my sister. 
yup. 
why would i be? 
what now? 
says who? 
...i'm going to see my sister. 
you're distracting me. 
i'm just blocking you out cause i gotta concentrate here. 
nobody wants to be alone. except maybe you 
you mean the love experts? 
...please tell me i'm almost there. 
...does the air seem a bit thin to you up here? kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her. 
ha ha. thank goodness. catch! 
thanks! that was like a crazy trust exercise. 
whoa. 
go ahead. i won't judge. 
ha. it opened. that's a first. 
you should probably wait out here. 
last time i introduced her to a guy, she froze everything. 
you too, olaf. 
just give us a minute. 
elsa? it's me...anna?! 
anna. 
elsa, you look different.... it's a good different.... and this place is amazing. 
thank you, i never knew what i was capable of. 
...i'm so sorry about what happened. if i'd known 
no, it's okay. you don't have to apologize.... but you should probably go, please. 
but i just got here. 
...you belong in arendelle. 
so do you. 
...actually, about that 
wait. what is that? 
olaf? 
and you're alive? 
he's just like the one we built as kids.... we were so close. we can be like that again. 
anna! 
no, we can't. 
goodbye, anna. 
elsa, wait 
i'm just trying to protect you. 
you don't have to protect me. i'm not afraid. please don't shut me out again. anna sings. 
please don't slam the door. you don't have to keep your distance anymore ‘cause for the first time in forever, i finally understand. for the first time in forever, we can fix this hand in hand. we can head down this mountain together. you don't have to live in fear. ‘cause for the first time in forever, i will be right here. 
anna, please go back home. your life awaits. go enjoy the sun and open up the gates. 
yeah, but 
i know! you mean well, but leave me be. yes, i'm alone but i'm alone and free. 
just stay away and you'll be safe from me. 
actually, we're not. 
what do you mean you're not? 
i get the feeling you don't know? 
what do i not know? 
arendelle's in deep deep deep deep snow. 
what? 
you kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere. 
everywhere? 
it's okay, you can just unfreeze it. 
no, i can't. i don't know how. 
sure you can. i know you can. 
cuz for the first time in forever, 
i'm such a fool! i can't be free! 
you don't have to be afraid. 
no escape from the storm inside of me! 
we can work this out together. 
i can't control the curse! 
we'll reverse the storm you've made. 
, please, you'll only make it worse! 
there's so much fear! 
we'll make the sun shine bright. 
you're not safe here! 
we can face this thing together... 
we can change this winter weather, and everything will be... 
i'm okay.... i'm fine. 
who's this? wait, it doesn't matter. you have to go. 
no, i know we can figure this out together 
how? what power do you have to stop this winter? to stop me? 
no. i'm not leaving without you, elsa. 
yes, you are. 
stop. put us down! 
olaf! 
it is not nice to throw people! 
let me at him. i want to get him. i.... okay. i'm calm. 
i got him! 
it's a hundred foot drop. 
ow.

...i'm ready to go.... 
...i was born ready! yes! 
olaf!

hey, you were right. just like a pillow. 
whoa! 
thank you. 
...um.... how's your head?

what? i just fell off a cliff. you should see your hair. 
white? it's what? 
does it look bad? 
the love experts? 
how do you know? 
get it together. control it. don't feel. don't feel. don't feel! 
...a little.

no....what have i done? 
why did you bring me here? 
but i'm a danger to arendelle. get anna. 
don't you see...i can't. 
you have to tell them to let me go. 
...are you ggonna be okay? 
hans, you have to kiss me. 
now. here we go. 
elsa struck me with her powers. 
i was wrong. 
she froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me. 
what? 
...you said you did. 
what are you talking about? 
hans? 
hans. no, stop. 
please. 
...you're no match for elsa. 
you won't get away with this. 
please, somebody help. 
help. 
olaf? olaf. get away from there. 
i was wrong about him. it wasn't true love. 
please olaf, you can't stay here; you'll melt. 
i don't even know what love is. 
...kristoff loves me? 
...theythey are?

oops. sorry. 
okay. okay. here we are. 
i owe you a sled.

we may. 
are you ready? 
i like the open gates. 
we are never closing them again. 
form on anna's boots.
what? oh, elsa, they're beautiful, but you know i don't ska
