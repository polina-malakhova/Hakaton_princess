well, and what are you three dears up to? 
berries? 
but i picked berries yesterday. 
goodbye! 
i wonder, i wonder, i wonder why each little bird has a someone to sing to sweet things to a gay little love melody. i wonder, i wonder, if my heart keeps singing will my song go winging to someone who'll find me and bring back a love song to me! 
oh dear, why do they still treat me like a child. 
why, flora and fauna and merryweather. they never want me to meet anyone. 
but you know something? i fooled 'em. i have met someone! 
oh, a prince. well, he's tall and handsome and ... and so romantic. oh we walked together, and talked together, and just before we say goodbye, he takes me in his arms, and then ... i wake up. 
yes, it's only in my dreams. but they say if you dream a thing more than once, it's sure to come true. and i've seen him so many times! 
oh, why, it's my dream prince! 
and i know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem but if i know you i know what you'll do you'll love me at once the way you did once upon a dream 
but if i know you i know what you'll do you'll love me at once 
oh? 
oh! 
oh it wasn't that. it's just that you're a, a ... 
hmmhmm. 
we, we have? 
hmm? oh, my name. why, it's, it's ... oh no, no, i can't, i ... goodbye! 
oh never, never! 
well, maybe someday. 
oh no, this evening. 
at the cottage, in the glen. 
and flora, 
and flora, fauna, merryweather! where is everybody? 
oh! 
oh you darlings, this is the happiest day of my life. everything's so wonderful, just wait till you meet him. 
oh he's not a stranger, we've met before. 
once upon a dream! 
i know you i walked with you once upon a dream ... 
why? after all, i am sixteen. 
betrothed? 
but that's impossible! how could i marry a prince, i'd have to be ... 
but, but i can't! he's coming here tonight, i promised to meet him. 
oh, no, no! i can't believe it. no, no!
