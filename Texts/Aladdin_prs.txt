oh, father. rajah was just playing with him, weren't you rajah. 
you were just playing with that overdressed, selfabsorbed prince achmed, weren't you? 
ahem. 
the law is wrong. 
father, i hate being forced into this. 
if i do marry, i want it to be for love. 
try to understand. i've never done a thing on my own. 
i've never had any real friends. 
except you, rajah. 
i've never even been outside the palace walls. 
then maybe i don't want to be a princess. 
oh, i'm sorry, rajah. but i can't stay here and have my life lived for me. i'll miss you.
good bye! 
i don't think so. 
oh, you must be hungry. here you go. 
pay? 
oh, i'm sorry sir. i don't have any money. 
please, if you let me go to the palace, i can get some from the sultan. 
no, no please! 
what are you doing? 
sadly, yes. she is my sister. she's a little crazy. 
oh, wise sultan. how may i serve you? 
oh, hello doctor. how are you? 
i want to thank you for stopping that man. 
is it that obvious? 
i'm a fast learner. 
is this where you live? 
fabulous. 
oh, it's wonderful. 
oh, sure. people who tell you where to go and how to dress. 
you're not free to make your own choices. 
you're just 
what does it matter? i ran away, and i am not going back. 
my father's forcing me to get married. 
what? 
oh did he? 
and does abu have anything else to say? 
hmm, tell him that's very sweet. 
my father must have sent them 
what? 
yes. 
let go of him. 
unhand him, by order of the princess. 
that's not your concern. do as i command. release him! 
believe me, i will. 
jafar? 
the guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders. 
what was the crime? 
he didn't kidnap me! i ran away! 
what do you mean? 
what sentence? 
no! 
how could you? 
it's all my fault, rajah. i didn't even know his name. 
jafar...has...done something... terrible. 
at least some good will come of my being forced to marry. when i am queen, i will have the power to get rid of you. 
how dare you! 
all of you, standing around deciding my future? i am not a prize to be won! 
who's there? 
i do not want to see you. 
wait, wait. do i know you? 
you remind me of someone i met in the marketplace. 
no, i guess not. 
punctual? 
hmm. i'm rich too, you know. 
the daughter of a sultan 
a fine prize for any prince to marry. 
right, a prince like you. and every other stuffed shirt, swaggering, peacock i've met! 
just go jump off a balcony! 
what!?! 
no! 
howhow are you doing that? 
it's lovely. 
is it safe? 
what? 
yes. 
a whole new world a dazzling place i never knew but when i'm way up here it's crystal clear that now i'm in a whole new world with you! 
unbelievable sights indescribable feeling soaring, tumbling, freewheeling through an endless diamond sky 
a whole new world! 
an hundred thousand things to see 
i'm like a shooting star, i've come so far i can't go back to where i used to be! 
every turn a surprise 
every moment, redletter

it's all so magical. 
it's a shame abu had to miss this. 
you are the boy from the market! i knew it. why did you lie to me? 
did you think i was stupid? 
that i wouldn't figure it out? 
who are you? tell me the truth! 
why didn't you just tell me? 
not that strange.
