i missed it. 
a willo'thewisp. 
they are real. 
i saw a wisp. i saw a wisp. 
well, he should, because that's true. 
some say our destiny is tied to the land, as much a part of us as we are of it. others say fate is woven together like a cloth, so that one's destiny intertwines with many others. it's the one thing we search for, or fight to change. some never find it. but there are some who are led. the story of how my father lost a leg to the demon bear mor'du became a legend. i became a sister with 3 new brothers, the princes hamish, hubert, and harris. wee devils more like. they get away with murder. i can never get away from anything! 
i'm the princess. i'm the example. i've got duties, responsibilities, expectations. my whole life is planned out, for the day i become, well, my mother! she's in charge of every single day of my life. sigh 
a robyn, jolly robyn, and thou shalt knowe of myn. 
and thou shalt knowe of myn . . . 
this is all for naught. 
but every once in a while, there's a day when i don't have to be a princess. 
and rides offno lessons, no expectations. a day when anything can happen. a day i can change my fate. 
i'm starving. you'd be too, i guess. 
poof. watch your – . 
whooosh! one swipe, his sword shattered, then, chomp! dad's leg was clean off! down the monster's throat it went. 
mor'du has never been seen since. and he's roaming the wild, awaiting his chance for revenge. 
mum. . . it's just my bow. 
mom, you'll never guess what i did, today! 
i climbed the crone's tooth and drank from the fire falls. 
nothing, mom. 
mom! 
who's accepted what, mother? 
what did i do now? 
what? 
dad! 
i'm the only princess that just does what she's told! 
no! what you've been preparing me for my whole life! 
i won't go through with it! you can't force me! 
mother! suitors! marriage! 
aah! mom! ancient kingdom! 
that's a nice story. 
ach, mom! 
it's not fair! 
call off the gathering! would that kill them? you're the queen, you can just tell the lords, the princess is not ready for this. in fact, she might not be ever ready for this! so that's that! 
i don't want my life to be over. i want my freedom! 
i'm not doing any of this to hurt you! 
but it's my life! i'm just not ready! 
i think i could make you understand, if you would just. . . 
listen! 
i swear, angus, this isn't going to happen. not if i can help it. 
i. . .i can't breath! 
i can't move! it's too tight! 
mom? 
first born? 
archery! archery! 
i choose archery. 
i bet he wishes he was tossing cabers. 
oh, that's attractive. 
good arm! 
oh, wee lamb. 
this dress! 
you're the one that want me to. . .! 
i followed the rules! 
i don't care how. . . 
just listen! 
oh! this is so unfair! 
you were never there for me! this whole marriage is what you want! do you ever bother to ask what i want? no! you walk around telling me what to do, what not to do! trying to make me be like you! well, i'm not going to be like you! 
and you're a beast! that's what you are! 
i will never be like you! 
i'd rather die than be like you! 
uh. . .who are you? 
um. . .i don't understand. 
your broom! 
it was sweeping by itself! 
aah! the crow's talking! 
you're a witch! 
that's why the wisp led me to you! 
you'll change my fate! 
you see, it's my mother. 
no, the wisp led me here! 
i'll buy it all! 
every carving. 
with this. 
every carving, and one spell. 
i want a spell to change my mom. that will change my fate. 
where are you going? what are you doing? 
and did he get what he was after? 
uh. . .a cake? 
yes! i want it! you're sure if i give this to my mom, it will change my fate? 
did you say something. . .about. . .the spell? 
mom! oh. . .uh. . .i. . .um. . . 
you. . .you were? 
oh, angus threw me. but i'm not hurt. 
honestly? 
it's a peace offering. i made it, for you! 
how do you feel? 
different? 
have you changed your mind at all about the marriage and all that? 
mother? 
mom! 
uh. . .how do you feel about the marriage now? 
just take all the time you need to get yourself right, mom. and maybe in a bit you might have something new to say on the marriage? 
cake! 
mom? so, i. . .i'll just tell them the wedding's off then? 
mom? 
bear! 
mom, you're. . ..you're a bear! you're a bear! oh, that scaffie witch gave me a gammy spell!! 
it's not my fault! i didn't ask her to change you into a bear. i just wanted her to change. . .you. 
there's no point in having a go at me! the witch is to blame! googly eye! 
i'll go over to her place. unbelievable! i'll get her to fix this. 
mom, you can't go out there! mom! what are you doing! 
dad! the bear king! if he so much as sees you, you're dead! 
mom! wait! 
stop! 
you're covered with fur! you're not naked! it's not like anyone's gonna see you! 
now you've done it. 
a witch turned mom into a bear. it's not my fault. we've got to get out of the castle. i need your help! 
oh, alright! you can have my deserts for two. . .three weeks! 
fine! a year! 
they'll be fine. won't you, boys? mom, we've got to hurry! 
now, i'll be back soon. go on and help yourself to anything you want, as a reward. 
where are these wisps? come out wisps. come on out! lead me to the witch's cottage! i'm here. fine, don't come out now that my mom's watching! 
i was standing right here, and the wisp appeared right there! then a whole trail of them led me off into the forest 
does she think that i just happened upon a witch's cottage? 
oh, mom! i know this place. the witch's cottage is this way! come on! hurry! 
i can't believe it! i found it! 
no! she was here! no, really! she was just here! oh, wait. 
no! 
no! no! no! 
fate be changed? mend the bond? what does that mean? 
no! no! where did you go! 
we'll sort it out tomorrow. 
uh. . .good morning. so, what's all this supposed to be? 
sorry, i don't speak bear. 
oh! 
find those by the creek, did you? they're nightshade berries. they're poisonous. 
where did you get this water? it has worms! 
come on. 
breakfast! 
oh, wait! a princess should not have weapons, in your opinion. 
there you go. go on. 
how do you know you don't like it if you won't try it? 
mom, come back! 
mom, is that you? 
mom? you changed! like you were a. . .i mean, like you were a bear on the inside. 
mom, look! why did the wisps bring us here? 
whoever they were, they've been gone for a long long tim. . . 
i'm fine, mom! fine! 
it's a. . .throne room. do you suppose this could have been the kingdom in that story you were telling me? the one with the princes? 
one, two, three, four. the oldest. like. . .like the tapestry. the spell! it's happened before! 
the strength of ten men. fate be changed. changed with fate. 
oh, no! the prince became. . . 
mor'du! 
mom, we need to get back to the castle. if we don't hurry, you'll become like mor'du! a bear! a real bear! forever! mend the bond torn by pride. the witch gave us the answer. the tapestry! 
yours was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship and it lives to this day. i've been selfish. i tore a great rift in our kingdom. there's no one to blame but me. and i know now that i need to amend my mistake and mend our bond. and so, there is the matter of my betrothal. i decided to do what's right, and. . . 
and. . .and break tradition. 
my mother, the queen, feels. . .uh, in her heart, that i. . .that we be free to. . .write our own story. follow our hearts, and find love in our time. ** probably the only other biblically sound thing in this movie, apart from “witchcraft is bad”. 
the queen and i put the decision to you my lords. might our people decide for themselves who they will love? 
everyone! to the cellar! lets crack open the king's private reserves to celebrate! everyone cheers and start heading for the cellar 
the tapestry! 
mend the bond. mend the bond! stitched up! this will change you back, we just needle and thread. 
mom! mom, not now! no! please, not now! mom! 
dad, no! it's not what you think! 
no! 
no, dad! don't hurt her! 
no! 
mom! 
it's alright. i'm alright. it's nothing. it's just a little scratch! 
mom! 
dad! 
it's your wife, elinor! 
it's the truth! there was a witch and she gave me a spell. it's not mor'du! 
no, dad! just listen to me! 
oh, no! 
maudie! 
get the key. 
get back! that's my mother! 
mom, are you hurt? 
i'll not let you kill my mother! 
boys! 
mor'du! 
the second sunrise! 
oh, no! i don't understand. i. . . 
oh, mom, i'm sorry. this is all my fault. i did this to you, to us. 
you've always been there for me. you've never given up on me. i just need you back. i want you back, mommy. i love you. 
mom! you're back! 
you've changed! 
oh, mom! 
some say fate is beyond our command, but i know better. our destiny is within us. you just have to be brave enough to see it.
