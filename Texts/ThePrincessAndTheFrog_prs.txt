stella, it's me, tiana! 
stella just talked to me! the dog just spoke to me! 
voodoo? you mean to tell me this all happened because you were messing with the shadow man? 
it serves me right for wishing on stars. the only way to get what you want in this world is through hard work. 
huh? oh, i'm not a princess. i'm a waitress. 
i...i never said i was a princess. 
it was a costume party, you spoiled little rich boy.

you are getting married! 
your modesty becomes you and your sense of responsibility i worked hard for everything i got and that's the way it's supposed to be when i'm a human being at least i'll act like one if you do your best each and every day good things are sure to come your way what you give is what you get! my daddy said that and now i'll never forget and i commend it to you 
i'm gonna do my best to take my place in the sun 
jambalaya, gumbo ...it's gonna have it all! it's gonna have it all! 
what are you doing? 
what? oh, no! no, no, no! there is no way i'm kissing a frog and eating a bug on the same day. . 
what are you doin'? stop moving! 
no, no, no, no ... 
this could be a little better. 
this is all your fault! 
no, no, no, that's not possible!

evangeline? 
oh, that's so sweet.

i can't hear you, i'm sorry. what?

we so glad we found you mama odie. ray and louis here been tellin' us all about you. we've been travelling quite a long way. and you can't imagine what we've been through. and we... and we heard that you ... 
mama odie ... we don't want to take too much of your time. 
no, no thank you. 
no, no, no, please. 
how on earth did you know that we want to turn back... 
mama odie, if you ... 
hit it hard with a couple of shots of tabasco, and it's the bee's knees! now, can we... 
it's just like you said, mama odie. we need to be human. y'all ain't got the sense y'all was born with! you want to be human ... but you blind to what you need. 
ma'am ? 
yes, ma'am. 
yes! i do, mama odie. i need to dig a little deeper and work even harder to get my restaurant. 
naveen, you comin'? 
where are you taking me? 
what's this? 
you minced! 
no, it's cute. 
there it is! 
oh, can you just picture it? all lit up like the fourth of july. 
it should be elegant. prince naveen you should keep it loose, let it swing 
you know a good ukulele player? 
i'll talk to the owner ... owner says...yes. folks are gonna be comin' together from all walks of life just to get a taste of our food. 
oh no, no, no. my daddy... he always wanted open this restaurant. he died before he could see it happened. but tomorrow ... with your help. our dream is finally comin' true. 
if i don't deliver that money first thing tomorrow, i lose this place forever. 
evangeline ... i've always been so sure about what i wanted. but now ... what do i do? please tell me. 
ray, have you seen naveen? 
what are you talking about? 
ray? 
you said just enough, ray! thank you, evangeline. he was trying to propose, that's what all that fumbling was about and here i thought, all he wanted was to marry a rich girl. 
you just keep your eyes at one of of the biggest gaudiest floats with a mardi gras princess about to kissed herself a ...a frog. 
just because you wish for somethin', doesn't make it true. 
evangeline is nothing but a star, ray! a big ball of hot air a million miles from here. open your eyes now! before you get hurt. 
ray? 
back off! or i'm gonna break this into a million pieces. naveen? 
shadow man? 
no. thisthis is not right. 
daddy! 
my daddy never did get what he wanted. but he had what he needed. he had love. never lost a sight what was really important. 
and neither will i. 
i got news for you, shadow man! it's not slime, it's mucus! 
wait! 
don't do this. 
i won't let you! 
my dream? my dream wouldn't be complete... without you in it. i love you, naveen. 
warts and all. 
ray? 
we are stayin' frogs, ray. and we are stayin' together. 
a princess. you just kissed yourself a princess!
