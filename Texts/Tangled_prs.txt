heal what has been hurt change the fate design save what has been lost bring back what once was mine 
so, mother, earlier i was saying tomorrow's a pretty big day and you didn't really respond, so i'm just gonna tell you, it's my birthday! uh. tada! 
that's the funny thing about birthdays–they're kind of an annual thing! uh, mother, i'm turning eighteen, and i wanted to ask, uh, what i really want for this birthday. . . actually what i really want for my birth–want for my birth– 
ah, i want to see the floating lights. 
oh. well, i was hoping you would take me to see the floating lights. 
that's the thing. i've charted stars and they're always constant–but these–they appear every year on my birthday, mother–only on my birthday. and i can't help but feel like they're. . . they're meant for me. i need to see them, mother, and not just from my window. in person. i have to know what they are. 
i know but. . . 
but– 
agh! 
no! 
but– 
ah! 
yes? 
yes, mother. 
i love you more. 
i'll be here. 
ah! 
oh. 
okay, okay, okay, i've got a person in my closet. i've got a person in my closet. i've got a person in my closet! haha! uh! too weak to handle myself out there, huh, mother? well. . . hmmhmm. . .tell that to my frying pan–
huh? 
oh! 
one moment, mother! 
uh, i do too! 
i seriously doubt it. 
well mother, there's something i want to tell you. 
okay, i've been thinking a lot about what you've said earlier 
i hope you're not still talking about the stars. 
‘floating lights', and, yes, i'm leading up to that, and. . . 
no, mother, i'm just saying, you think i'm not strong enough to handle myself out there. 
but if you just– 
trust me– 
i know what i'm saying–
oh, come on– 
all i was gonna say, mother, is that, i know what i want for my birthday now. 
new paint. the paint made from the white shells you once brought me. 
i just thought it was a better idea than. . . stars. 
i know i'm safe as long as i'm here. 
i love you more. 
okay.
uh? 
hmm. 
struggling. . . struggling is pointless. 
i know why you're here, and i'm not afraid of you. 
who are you? and how did you find me? 
who are you, and how did you find me? 
ugh! who else knows my location, flynn rider? 
rapunzel. 
i've hidden it, somewhere you'll never find it. 
now it's hidden where you'll never find it. so, what do you want with my hair? to cut it? 
sell it? 
yi. wait. you don't want my hair? 
you're. . . telling the truth? 
i know, i need someone to take me. 
i think he's telling the truth, too. 
doesn't have fangs, but what choice do i have? 
huh. okay, flynn rider, i'm prepared to offer you a deal. 
look this way. 
do you know what these are? 
lanterns. i knew they weren't stars. well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky with these lanterns.you will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely. then, and only then, will i return your satchel to you. that is my deal. 
something brought you here, flynn rider. call it what you will, fate, destiny. . . 
so i have made the decision to trust you. 
but trust me when i tell you this. 
you can tear this tower apart brick by brick, but without my help, you will never find your precious satchel. 
i promise. and when i promise something, i never ever break that promise. ever. 
really? oops.
