little town, it's a quiet village every day, like the one before little town, full of little people waking up to say... 
there goes the baker with his tray like always the same old bread and rolls to sell ev'ry morning just the same since the morning that we came to this poor provincial town... 
morning monsieur! 
the bookshop! i just finished the most wonderful story, about a beanstalk and an ogre and... 
there must be more than this provincial life! 
good morning. i've come to return the book i borrowed. 
oh, i couldn't put it down! have you got anything new? 
that's all right. i'll borrow... this one. 
well it's my favorite! 
far off places, daring swordfights, magic spells, a prince in disguise! 
but sir! 
well thank you. thank you very much! 
oh! isn't this amazing! it's my favorite part because, you'll see! here's where she meets prince charming but she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three! 
there must be more than this provincial life! 
bonjour gaston. 
gaston, may i have my book, please? 
well, some people use their imaginations. 
gaston, you are positively primeval. 
maybe some other time. 
please, gaston. i can't. i have to get home and help my father. 
don't you talk about my father that way! 
my father's not crazy! he's a genius! 
papa? 
are you all right, papa? 
you always say that. 
yes, you will. and you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow 
...and become a world famous inventor! 
i always have. 
i got a new book. papa, do you think i'm odd? 
oh, i don't know. it's just i'm not sure i fit in here. there's no one i can really talk to. 
he's handsome all right, and rude and conceited and...oh papa, he's not for me! 
it works! 
you did it! you really did it! 
good bye, papa! good luck! 
gaston, what a pleasant...surprise. 
what do you know about my dreams, gaston? 
dogs? 
imagine that. 
let me think. 
gaston, i'm speechless. i really don't know what to say. 
i'm very sorry, gaston, but i just don't deserve you. 
. belle ducks under gaston as he tumbles out the door and into the mud.
is he gone? can you imagine, he asked me to marry him. me, the wife of that boorish, brainless... madame gaston, can't you just see it madame gaston, his little wife not me, no sir, i guarantee it i want much more than this provincial life... 
i want adventure in the great wide somewhere i want it more than i can tell and for once it might be grand to have someone understand i want so much more than they've got planned 
phillipe! what are you doing here? where's papa? where is he, phillipe? what happened? oh, we have to find him, you have to take me to him! 
what is this place? 
phillipe, please, steady. 
papa. 
hello? is anyone here? hello? papa? papa, are you here? 
papa? 
papa? papa? 
hello? is someone here? wait! i'm looking for my father! 
that's funny, i'm sure there was someone... iiis there anyone here? 
oh, papa! 
oh, your hands are like ice. we have to get you out of here. 
who's done this to you? 
i won't leave you! 
who's there? who are you? 
i've come for my father. please let him out! can't you see he's sick? 
but he could die. please, i'll do anything! 
oh, there must be some way i can...wait! take me, instead! 
if i did, would you let him go? 
come into the light. 
you have my word. 
wait! 
wait! 
you didn't even let me say good bye. i'll never see him again. i didn't get to say goodbye. 
my room? 
no. 
what's in the west wing? 
who is it? 
but you...ah...but...i 
this is impossible 
thank you. 
but i've lost my father, my dreams, everything. 
that's very kind of you, but i'm not going to dinner. 
i'm not hungry. 
no! 
no, thank you. 
yes i can! 
i don't want to get to know him. i don't want to have anything to do with him! 
i am a little hungry. 
bravo! that was wonderful! 
oh, i couldn't possibly go to bed now. it's my first time in an enchanted castle. 
i, um, figured it out for myself. 
i'd like to look around, if that's all right. 
perhaps you could take me. i'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle. 
what's up there? 
oh, so that's the west wing. 
i wonder what he's hiding up there. 
then it wouldn't be forbidden. 
maybe later. 
you have a library? 
i'm sorry, 
i didn't mean any harm. 
please, stop! no! 
promise or no promise, i can't stay here another minute! 
here now. oh, don't do that. 
just...hold still. 
if you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much. 
well if you hadn't frightened me, i wouldn't have run away! 
well you should learn to control your temper! 
now, hold still. this may sting a little. 
by the way, thank you, for saving my life. 
can i open them? 
now can i open them? 
i can't believe it. i've never seen so many books in all my life! 
it's wonderful. 
there's something sweet and almost kind but he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined. but now he's dear and so unsure, i wonder why i didn't see it there before. 
new, and a bit alarming who'd have ever thought that this could be? true, that he's no prince charming but there's something in him that i simply didn't see. 
yes. 
if only i could see my father again, just for a moment. i miss him so much. 
i'd like to see my father, please. 
papa. oh, no. he's sick, he may be dying. and he's all alone. 
what did you say? 
you mean...i'm free? 
oh, thank you. 
hold on, papa. i'm on my way. 
thank you for understanding how much he needs me. 
it's all right, papa. i'm home. 
i missed you so much. 
i didn't escape, papa. he let me go. 
but he's different, now. he's changed somehow. 
oh, a stowaway. 
oh, chip. of course i do. it's just that 
may i help you? 
my father? 
my father's not crazy. 
no, i won't let you. 
no, you can't do this! 
you know he's not crazy, gaston. 
if what? 
what? 
never! 
my father's not crazy and i can prove it! 
show me the beast! 
oh, no. he'd never hurt anyone. please, i know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle. he's my friend. 
he's no monster, gaston. you are! 
no! 
no, i won't let you do this. 
let us out! 
i have to warn the beast. this is all my fault. oh, papa. what are we going to do? 
no! 
gaston, don't! 
let's go, phillipe! 
beast! 
of course i came back. i couldn't let them...oh this is all my fault. if only i'd gotten here sooner. 
don't talk like that. you'll be all right. we're together now. everything's going to be fine. you'll see. 
no, no! please! please! please don't leave me! i love you! 
it is you!
